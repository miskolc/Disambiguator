This is the sense tagged "line" data, as used in numerous comparative 
studies of word sense disambiguation methodologies. In brief, each 
instance of line has been tagged with one of six WordNet senses. Further
details can be found in the papers mentioned below.

(Please credit Leacock et. al. with the creation of this data.  I am
simply distributing this data and played no role in its creation.)

It has since been used and described in the following:
